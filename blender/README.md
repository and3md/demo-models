# Blender demos with Castle Game Engine and glTF and X3D

Test of some export features from [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

The Blender examples are actually scattered throughout this repository (lots of other demos were made in Blender), and in many other Castle Game Engine projects: https://github.com/castle-engine/ . Blender is our primary 3D authoring software, given that it's open-source and packed with features.

Information how to export from Blender to Castle Game Engine is on https://castle-engine.io/creating_data_blender.php .
