Testing occlusion texture effect in glTF.

The occlusion.png is baked from Blender, and deliberately made more emphasized in GIMP
(original in occlusion_original.png, hard to see the difference even).

See https://github.com/michaliskambi/x3d-tests/wiki/How-to-add-PBR-to-X3D%3F#is-the-equation-to-apply-occlusion-correct
for reasons of this test.
